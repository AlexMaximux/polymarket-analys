/**
 * UP/DOWN signal priced against what a trade would actually cost.
 *
 * Backtest (8 weeks of Polymarket 1H history, 2026-07-31..09-25): comparing fair values with the
 * CLOB midpoint produced ~380 alerts/day that looked +1..3¢ at the mid but lost 2..4¢ per trade once the
 * spread and the taker fee were paid. So a signal now needs BOTH fair values (15m-drift and Base) to
 * beat the executable price plus the fee by a margin, on a book tight enough to trade.
